## Riemannian optimization on symplectic Stiefel manifold with manopt

### Task
The task was to go carfully through the paper [Riemannian Optimization on the Symplectic Stiefel Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15226) and reproduce the numerical experiments using Python's [Manopt](https://www.manopt.org/) toolbox.

## Run locally
run the command `git clone https://github.com/AlicKaufmann/Riemannian-Optimization`
